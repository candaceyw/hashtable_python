Hashtable implemntation in Python

```
Map
The idea of a dictionary used as a hash table to get and retrieve items using keys is often referred 
to as a mapping. In our implementation we will have the following methods:

• HashTable() Create a new, empty map. It returns an empty map collection.
• put(key,val) Add a new key-value pair to the map. If the key is already in the map then 
replace the old value with the new value.
• get(key) Given a key, return the value stored in the map or None otherwise.
• del Delete the key-value pair from the map using a statement of the form del map[key].
• len() Return the number of key-value pairs stored
• in the map in Return True for a statement of the form key in map, if the given key is in the map, False otherwise.
